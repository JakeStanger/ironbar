Ironbar includes a simple IPC server which can be used to control it programmatically at runtime.

It also includes a command line interface, which can be used for interacting with the IPC server.

# CLI

This is shipped as part of the `ironbar` binary. To view commands, you can use `ironbar --help`. 
You can also view help per sub-command or command, for example using `ironbar var --help` or `ironbar var set --help`.

The CLI supports plaintext and JSON output. Plaintext will:

- Print `ok` for empty success responses
- Print the returned body for success responses
- Print `error` to followed by the error on the next line for error responses. This is printed to `stderr`.

Example:

```shell
$ ironbar var set subject world
ok

$ ironbar var get subject
world

$ ironbar var get foo
error
Variable not found
```

All error responses will cause the CLI to exit code 3.

# IPC

The server listens on a Unix socket. 
The path is printed on startup, and can usually be found at `/run/user/$UID/ironbar-ipc.sock`.

Commands and responses are sent as JSON objects.

Commands will have a `command` key, and a `subcommand` key when part of a sub-command.

The message buffer is currently limited to `1024` bytes. 
Particularly large messages will be truncated or cause an error.

The full spec can be found below.
