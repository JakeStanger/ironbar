Ironbar includes a simple IPC server which can be used to control it programmatically at runtime.

It also includes a command line interface, which can be used for interacting with the IPC server.

# CLI

This is shipped as part of the `ironbar` binary. To view commands, you can use `ironbar --help`. 
You can also view help per-command, for example using `ironbar set --help`.

Responses are handled by writing their type to stdout, followed by any value starting on the next line.
Error responses are written to stderr in the same format.

Example:

```shell
$ ironbar set subject world
ok

$ ironbar get subject
ok
world
```

# IPC

The server listens on a Unix socket. 
This can usually be found at `/run/user/$UID/ironbar-ipc.sock`.

Commands and responses are sent as JSON objects, denoted by their `type` key.

The message buffer is currently limited to `1024` bytes. 
Particularly large messages will be truncated or cause an error.

The full spec can be found below.
